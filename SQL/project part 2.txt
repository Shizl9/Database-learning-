-- Database Project Part 2: Advanced Queries, Views, and Stored Procedures
-- Course: Database Management Systems
-- Prerequisites: Completion of Database Project Part 1
-- Topics Covered: Joins, Aggregation Functions, Grouping, Views, Stored Procedures
-- 
-- Assumptions:
-- - Database schema from Part 1 includes tables: Libraries, Books, Members, Staff, Loans, Payments, Reviews.
-- - Key columns: Libraries(id, name), Books(id, title, isbn, genre, price, available, library_id), 
--   Members(id, name, email, phone, library_id), Staff(id, name, position, library_id), 
--   Loans(id, member_id, book_id, loan_date, due_date, return_date, status), 
--   Payments(id, loan_id, amount, method, status, date), Reviews(id, member_id, book_id, rating, review_text, date).
-- - Status values for Loans: 'Issued', 'Overdue', 'Returned'.
-- - Available in Books: 1 for available, 0 for not.
-- - Fine calculation: $2 per day overdue.
-- - Dates use SQL DATE functions (e.g., CURDATE(), DATEDIFF).
-- - Members are associated with libraries via library_id.
-- - Sufficient test data exists (at least 3 libraries, 20 books, 10 members, 15 loans).
-- - All queries/views/procedures are adapted to the assumed schema.

-- Section 1: Complex Queries with Joins (40 points)

-- 1. Library Book Inventory Report
-- Displays library name, total number of books, number of available books, and number of books currently on loan for each library.
SELECT l.library_name,
       COUNT(b.book_id) AS total_books,
       SUM(CASE WHEN b.availability_status = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS available_books,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN ln.status IN ('Issued', 'Overdue') THEN 1 END) AS books_on_loan
FROM library l
LEFT JOIN Books b ON l.library_id = b.library_id
LEFT JOIN loans ln ON b.book_id = ln.book_id AND ln.status IN ('Issued', 'Overdue')
GROUP BY l.library_id, l.library_name;

-- 2. Active Borrowers Analysis
-- Lists all members who currently have books on loan (status = 'Issued' or 'Overdue'). Shows member name, email, book title, loan date, due date, and current status.
SELECT m.full_name, m.email, b.title, ln.loan_date, ln.due_date, ln.status
FROM members m
JOIN loans ln ON m.member_id = ln.member_id
JOIN Books b ON ln.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE ln.status IN ('Issued', 'Overdue');

-- 3. Overdue Loans with Member Details
-- Retrieves all overdue loans showing member name, phone number, book title, library name, days overdue (calculated as difference between current date and due date), and any fines paid for that loan.
SELECT m.full_name, m.phone, b.title, l.library_name,
       DATEDIFF(DAY, ln.due_date, GETDATE()) AS days_overdue,
       COALESCE(p.amount, 0) AS fines_paid
FROM loans ln
JOIN members m ON ln.member_id = m.member_id
JOIN Books b ON ln.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN library l ON b.library_id = l.library_id
LEFT JOIN payment p ON ln.loan_id = p.loan_id
WHERE ln.status = 'Overdue' AND ln.due_date < GETDATE();

-- 4. Staff Performance Overview
-- For each library, shows the library name, staff member names, their positions, and count of books managed at that library.
SELECT 
    l.library_name,s.full_name AS staff_name,s.position,
    COUNT(b.book_id) AS books_managed
FROM library l
JOIN Staff s ON l.library_id = s.library_id
LEFT JOIN Books b ON l.library_id = b.library_id
GROUP BY l.library_id, l.library_name, s.staff_id, s.full_name, s.position
ORDER BY l.library_name, s.full_name;


-- 5. Book Popularity Report
-- Displays books that have been loaned at least 3 times. Includes book title, ISBN, genre, total number of times loaned, and average review rating (if any reviews exist).
-- Approach: Use JOINs to link books to loans and reviews, GROUP BY book details, and HAVING to filter books loaned >=3 times. Aggregate rating with AVG.
SELECT 
    b.title,
    b.ISBN,
    b.genre,
    COUNT(ln.loan_id) AS times_loaned,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM Books b
JOIN loans ln ON b.book_id = ln.book_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON b.book_id = r.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title, b.ISBN, b.genre
HAVING COUNT(ln.loan_id) >= 3;

-- 6. Member Reading History
-- Shows each member's complete borrowing history including: member name, book titles borrowed (including currently borrowed and previously returned), loan dates, return dates, and any reviews they left for those books.
-- Approach: JOIN members to loans to books, and LEFT JOIN to reviews. This covers all loans (past and present) with associated reviews.
SELECT m.full_name, b.title, ln.loan_date, ln.return_date, r.comments
FROM members m
JOIN loans ln ON m.member_id = ln.member_id
JOIN Books b ON ln.book_id = b.book_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON m.member_id = r.member_id AND b.book_id = r.book_id;

-- 7. Revenue Analysis by Genre
-- Calculates total fine payments collected for each book genre. Shows genre name, total number of loans for that genre, total fine amount collected, and average fine per loan.
-- Approach: JOIN books to loans to payments, GROUP BY genre, and use aggregation for counts and sums.
SELECT b.genre, COUNT(ln.loan_id) AS total_loans,
       SUM(COALESCE(p.amount, 0)) AS total_fines,
       AVG(COALESCE(p.amount, 0)) AS avg_fine_per_loan
FROM Books b
JOIN loans ln ON b.book_id = ln.book_id
LEFT JOIN payment p ON ln.loan_id = p.loan_id
GROUP BY b.genre;


-- Section 2: Aggregate Functions and Grouping (30 points)

-- 8. Monthly Loan Statistics
-- Generates a report showing the number of loans issued per month for the current year. Includes month name, total loans, total returned, and total still issued/overdue.

       COUNT(*) AS total_loans,
       SUM(CASE WHEN ln.status = 'Returned' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_returned,
       SUM(CASE WHEN ln.status IN ('Issued','Overdue') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS still_issued
FROM loans ln
WHERE YEAR(ln.loan_date) = YEAR(GETDATE())
GROUP BY MONTH(ln.loan_date), DATENAME(MONTH, ln.loan_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(ln.loan_date);

-- 9. Member Engagement Metrics
-- For each member, calculates: total books borrowed, total books currently on loan, total fines paid, and average rating they give in reviews. Only includes members who have borrowed at least one book.
SELECT m.full_name,
       COUNT(ln.loan_id) AS total_borrowed,
       SUM(CASE WHEN ln.status IN ('Issued','Overdue') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS currently_on_loan,
       SUM(COALESCE(p.amount,0)) AS total_fines,
       AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM members m
JOIN loans ln ON m.member_id = ln.member_id
LEFT JOIN payment p ON ln.loan_id = p.loan_id
LEFT JOIN review r ON m.member_id = r.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id, m.full_name
HAVING COUNT(ln.loan_id) >= 1;

LEFT JOIN members m ON ln.member_id = m.member_id
LEFT JOIN payment p ON ln.loan_id = p.loan_id
GROUP BY l.library_name;


-- 11. High-Value Books Analysis

SELECT b.title, b.genre, b.price,
       AVG(b2.price*1.0) AS genre_avg_price,
       b.price - AVG(b2.price*1.0) AS difference
FROM Books b
JOIN Books b2 ON b.genre = b2.genre
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title, b.genre, b.price
HAVING b.price > AVG(b2.price);
